DESCRIPTION OF 3RD STATISTIC: 
My custom statistic is an attempt at identifying champion role and usefulness in a game. 
The foundational assumption is that more people want to play ADC's and flashy champs with lots of late game kills (carry champs), so the champs which occupy other roles likely have higher win rates.
So the top-rated champions all have good early-game assist potential and low late-game kill potential (characteristic of support, tank and utility characters). 
The specific mix of high early assists, low late kills, high win rate, and high deaths (a characteristic of teh squishier ADC champs) works well to identify champions which are more suited to utility and support.


RESULTS FROM 3RD STATISTIC:
The first 10 champions obtained by this metric:

Ashe
Vladimir
Nidalee
Fizz
Hecarim
Sejuani
Zed
Caitlyn
Sona
Quinn

The last 10 champions obtained by this metric:

Malphite
Corki
Jax
Teemo
Garen
Kayle
Swain
Annie
Katarina
Veigar

The average win rate of the first twenty champions: .515
The average win rate of the last twenty champions: .486

The bottom 10 are all much more used champions than the top 10 (with the exception of Ashe, due to her incredibly high win rate).
