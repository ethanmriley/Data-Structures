TESTING & DEBUGGING STRATEGY: 
Discuss your strategy for testing & debugging your program.  
What tools did you use (gdb/lldb/Visual Studio debugger,
Valgrind/Dr. Memory, std::cout & print, etc.)?  How did you test the
"corner cases" of your implementation?

To be honest, I couldn't get it working, so I didn't really have much room for corner cases.
GDB helped a lot, because I could work through the assert statements and segfaults and figure out what was causing what errors.
Valgrind was also useful in writing the destructor, but GDB helped the most due to an odd memory bug.




MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  
It doesn't work nearly as much as it should, but I tried to keep what does work looking neat and readable. 
Please have mercy.
